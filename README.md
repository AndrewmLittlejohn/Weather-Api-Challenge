### update

When I initially worked on this challenge I had a number of issues that I couldn't address so I never submitted, and hadn't ever setup a git repository.

These were

## issue 1
Those were, not being able to get the recent search history to update, I have made minimal progress at this point early AM 2.17.23, to where 
when I do a sixth search the first one goes away and the six search remains on the list and the list is 5 searches long. After that search the subsiquent searches don't cause a search to be removed rather they simply make the list longer.

# current as of 23.2.21

Five searches show in the HTML, additional searches are still available in the local storage. 


## issue 2 
When I click on a previously searched city to have it run a query to the API I currently don't pass in the city name, so it is sent as black and the API returns Bay Minette when I send a blank request. 

# current as on 23.2.21

API returns the highest value idex city, has to do with the looping.

## issue 3
one my 5-day forecase the condictions icons are sporatic, I generally get the icons so show up on one or three of the five days, though which days varies. I did confirm that all days have the conditions section setup the same and even when passed the same info one will show and one won't. 

# current as of 23.2.21 
  I have added the verbal descriptor as well. This demonstrates that the info needed for the icons is being received. 

  I have a suspicion that there is an issue with using font awesome in this fashion, not to say that the issue is with font awesome but there are issues taking place at deeper layers where I don't have the understanding to find or fix them at this point. I plan to resubmit later once I have had the chance to change out the icons being used.
